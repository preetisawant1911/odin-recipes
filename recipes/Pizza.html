<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
</li>
  <li> Pizza sauce (tomato-based)</li>
  <li> Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
  <li>Olive oil (for brushing crust)</li>
  <li> Dried oregano (herb seasoning)</li>
  <li>Dried basil (or fresh basil leaves)</li>
  <li>Garlic (optional, for flavor)</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Preheat the oven.:Set oven to 250°C (or highest). Put a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet in the oven while it heats. Preheat at least 20–30 minutes so the surface is very hot.
</li>
  <li>Bring dough to room temperature.If dough is refrigerated, take it out 30–60 minutes before shaping so it becomes pliable.
</li>
  <li> Shape the dough.Lightly flour your work surface. Press the dough from center outward with fingertips, stretch with your knuckles while rotating until you get a ~12″ (30 cm) circle. Keep a slightly thicker rim for the crust.
</li>
  <li>Prepare the baking surface.Transfer the stretched dough onto a piece of parchment (or a floured pizza peel). Dust with semolina or flour so it slides easily.
</li>
  <li>Brush the crust.Lightly brush the outer rim with a little olive oil — helps browning.
</li>
  <li>Add sauce.Spoon ~½ cup pizza sauce into the center and spread evenly, leaving a 1–1.5 cm (½ inch) rim.
</li>
<li>Flavor base (optional).Sprinkle minced garlic over the sauce if using. Add a tiny pinch of salt to balance the tomato sauce if needed.
<li>Cheese time.Evenly spread the shredded mozzarella across the pizza. Add a little grated parmesan if you like extra flavor.
<li>Bake.Slide pizza (with parchment) onto the hot stone or baking tray. Bake 8–12 minutes at 250°C until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly. If your oven is weaker, bake at 220°C for 12–15 minutes. For extra char, broil 1–90 seconds at the end — watch carefully.
